        If your problem can be modeled with a low-order polynomial equation, then it won't stay a problem for long. Let's look at the forms of the four simplest orders:
    </p>
    
    <dl>
        <dt>Constant</dt>
        <dd>Constant polynomials have the form a.</dd>
        <dt>Linear</dt>
        <dd> Linear polynomials have the form a  &#215; x &#43; b.</dd>
        <dt>Quadratic</dt>
        <dd> Quadratic polynomials have the form a &#215; x&sup2; &#43; b &#215; x &#43; c.</dd>
        <dt>Cubic</dt>
        <dd>Cubic polynomails have the form a &#215; x&sup3; &#43; b &#215; x&sup2; &#43; c &#215; x &#43; d.</dd>
